        <h2>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
        <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump <p> over to the 
            Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

    <p class="headertext">How I stay committed to learning <p>


        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
        then try to
        create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.

        <p id="witch"> While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most 
            things about my
        journey with the world. 

        </p>

        <div class="content-two ">
        <p class="headertext"> How it got started <p>
  
        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
         learning.
        After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned  <p>but also write 
        short
        summaries of what I learned using my own words. 

        <p id="witch"> That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
        others learn and stay motivated. </p>
    </p>
